\section{Proposed Approach}\label{sec:proposed_approach}

We can see that the literature available, while not on computational responsibility formalisms, are all fairly related to constructing the formalism proposed. In light of this, we can begin to identify some of the components of a suitable formalism:\par

\begin{itemize}
    \item The formalism should answer the research questions laid out in the problem statement\cref{sec:statement_of_problem}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How can a computational formalism of responsibility direct the decisions made by an intelligent agent?
            \item How can an intelligent agent assume the consequences of actions it makes, the decisions other agents make, and its general environment, so as to direct its interpretation of responsibility?
        \end{enumerate}
    \item The formalism should suitably limit the scope of the actors it models to be reactive, reflective agents\cref{sec:agent_types}.\\
        The formalism doesn't apply to all agents; we can imagine some agents which are *not* responsible, such as those shown by Strawson\cref{sec:strawson}, and agents which aren't reactive or reflective.
    \item The formalism should interpret the obligation an agent is assigned when another agent trusts it with a causal responsibility.
    \item Ideally, the formalism would utilise as much relevant psychology and sociology literature as possible so as to maximise the formalism's interdisciplinary potential.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A responsibility formalism's constituent elements}
\subsubsection{A trust formalism}
A useful exercise is to discern what a responsibility formalism would consist of. Worth noting is that this formalism is a proof-of-concept and a starting point for further research to refine. Therefore, a simple model which is easy to implement correctly and reason about should be paramount.\par

With this in mind, one important constituent part is that of the trust model the formalism works in tandem with. While this could in theory be any model, three notions are worth bearing in mind when selecting one.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The trust formalism selected should act as a starting point for the responsibility formalism's design, because of the similarities between trust and responsibility.
    \item The trust formalism should express gradations of trust, rather than a boolean logical approach. This is important as the trust an agent has in another agent will allow the former to assess how responsible the latter is; these agents may be required to make judgements of \emph{how} responsibile other agents may be, so they might choose one agent to be responsible for a goal over another.
    \item The trust formalism should be simple, to act as a basis for the design of a simple responsibility formalism.
\end{enumerate}

To satisfy all of these aims, Marsh's seminal trust formalism seems most appropriate. This is for a number of reasons. For example, Marsh's formalism is very easy to understand and implement --- particularly with it being an early formalism uncomplicated by later literature. Another reason is that Marsh's formalism allows one to express gradations of trust; in contrast to another model, such as Castelfranchi \& Falcone's model, Marsh's formalism requires no additional complexity to model trust gradation.\par

Marsh's model is also constructed with other disciplines in mind --- psychology and sociology feature prominently in its cited literature. However, Marsh cites no philosophical advancements in his model; therefore, the application of moral responsibility to the formalism being designed cannot be based on similar work used with this formalism.\par

% What are we going to borrow from the literature?
\subsection{Literature influence on the formalism's elements}
\subsubsection{Formalism designed like Marsh's}
The model of responsibility being designed requires the ability to model gradations of trust; therefore, Marsh's Trust formalism will act as the template for the responsibility formalism's design. In particular, Marsh's model's segregation oftypes of trust are useful for establishing the basic principles behind the responsibility model:

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    \emph{Marsh's Trust} & \emph{Responsibility Formalism}\\
    Basic Trust & Basic Responsibility\\
    General Trust & General Responsibility\\
    Specific Trust & Specific Repsonsibility\\
\end{tabular}

Using Marsh's model and adopting the jargon he develops means we can keep lots of the notions he develops, such as variable domains and seperation of different ``levels'' of responsibility, such as how generally responsible an agent is, and how responsible an agent is for a very specific thing. Indeed, a layout of the variables we might use in a formalism of responsibility, compared to Marsh's, might look like this:

\begin{tabular}{c c}
    \emph{Marsh's Trust Model Variables} & \emph{Responsibility Formalism's Variables}\\
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Knowledge (of x at time t) & True/False\\
        Importance (of knowing fact x at time t) & \([0,+1]\)\\
        Utility (of action \safealpha at time t to an agent) & \([-1,+1]\)\\
        Basic Trust (of agent A at time t) & \([-1,+1)\)\\
        General Trust (of agent A at time t in agent B) & \([-1,+1)\)\\
        Situational Trust (of agent A at time t in agent B doing action \safealpha) & \([-1,+1)\)\\
      \end{tabular} & 
      \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Basic Responsibility (of agent A at time t) & \([-1,+1)\)\\
        General Responsibility (of agent A at time t in agent B) & \([-1,+1)\)\\
        Situational Responsibility (of agent A at time t in agent B doing action \safealpha) & \([-1,+1)\)\\
      \end{tabular}\\
\end{tabular}

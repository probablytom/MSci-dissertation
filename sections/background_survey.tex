% What work's been done already? 
Unlike Computational Responsibility, Computational Trust is a topic which has a surprising degree of pre-existing literature. Marsh~\cite{Marsh1994FormalisingConcept} draws inspiration from as early as David Birkhoff's 1930s work in creating an `Aesthetic Measure', where the famous mathematician created a quantification of Aesthetics. While some dispute that such subjective topics can be boiled down to a single number (or array thereof), much work to the contrary has now been completed. Like Marsh, we should start from the beginning.

\section{Social Sciences and Mathematics}
\subsection{Birkhoff's Aesthetic Measure}
One of the earlier formalisms of a human factor\footnote{For the sake of clarification, we define a ``human factor'' as an element of a social or sociotechnical system which arises from human behaviour, such as Trust.}\footnote{Also for the sake of clarifying a sociotechnical system, a sociotechnical system is a system composed of human tendencies and behaviours, such as Trust, alongside technical activity, such as a computer or a steam engine. An example might be a coffee shop: \begin{itemize}
    \item Humans take orders and manage the running of the shop
    \item Technology is responsible for complex activities such as taking payments and forcing steam through coffee at high pressure
\end{itemize} so there are both social and technical actors and behaviours in the ``system'' of a day-to-day coffee shop.} was Birkhoff's definition of Aesthetic Measure\cite{BirkhoffAESTHETICMEASURE}. In it, Birkhoff defines the notion of Aesthetic Measure as a ratio of Order to Complexity:
\[M = \frac{O}{C}\]
Birkhoff's work inadvertently gave rise to the notion that human factors can be represented by mathematical equations and systems. Birkhoff's formalism of aesthetics became popular for a few reasons, but one of particular interest to later Trust modelling work was that Birkhoff put a great degree of effort into backing his work up with psychological theory. In this way, Birkhoff's formalism could be said to be a \emph{psychological} formalism. \par

Later trust modelling work followed in Birkhoff's footsteps here. Indeed, Birkhoff gives a solid foundation for the model-creating method later employed by Marsh\cite{Marsh1994FormalisingConcept} and Castelfranchi \& Falcone, as it is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Founded on mathematical or logical principles which are \emph{quantifiable}
    \item Heavily inspired and directed by related work in psychology, sociology, and philosophy
\end{itemize}\par

The marriage of social studies with mathematical rigour will be a recurring theme of the work related to Computational Trust.\par

\subsection{Deutsch}
Following the quantifiable, mathematical work done by Birkhoff, logical and arithmetic formalisms of human factors followed. One of the earlier and more widely adopted models for Trust came from Deutsch in 1962. 
Deutsch is a psychologist who did swathes of work in the topic of cooperation, touching on Trust during the 60s. \par

Deutsch's formalism of trust wasn't immediately quantifiable, but presented one of the earliest well-defined definitions of trust. To paraphrase Deutsch's formalism in ``Cooperation and Trust: Some Theoretical Notes'', 1962\todo{CITE THIS}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An actor is presented with a choice between two paths.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{\Alph*}:]
        \item No change
        \item The actor takes some action, of ambiguous outcome. A possible gain is associated, \emph{P}, and some possible risk is associated, \emph{R}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The actor assesses that the outcome of choice \emph{B} relies on the behaviour of another actor.
    \item The actor assesses the action they may take and resolves that the strength of \emph{R}, likelihood of \emph{R} as an outcome, or both are higher than the respective \emph{P} measurements.
    \item The actor is said to be \emph{trusting} they take path \emph{B}.
\end{itemize}

This formalism introduces some interesting notions. For example, it is unclear as to whether the outcome of choice \emph{B} can rely on the same actor making the decision; can one trust oneself by Deutsch's definition? Another interesting analysis of the implications of Deutsch's model is that it does not rely on the \emph{accurate} measurement of risk and utility, but just its perception --- trust is subjective, and based on the trusting actor's perspective on the world.

Rather than characterising trust by the parties involved, Deutsch's formalism is characterised by \emph{risk and utility}. A simple quantification of Deutsch's formalism could be devised, therefore, where risk and utility are quantified by simple assessments using utility functions and a form of risk analysis. Even so, the outcome of this quantified system is a single bit: trusting or not trusting. This does quantify trust, but only technically speaking, and this quantification is weak in its expressiveness. It gives no remit to suggest that one might trust one person over another, for example, as there are no orderable degrees of trust.

Deutsch offers many different ideas as to why and how trust or trust-like behaviour can come about, however. This list is taken from Marsh 1994\cite{Marsh1994FormalisingConcept}, where explanations of all nine can be found:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Trust as Despair
    \item Trust as Social Confirmity
    \item Trust as Innocence
    \item Trust as Impulsiveness
    \item Trust as Virtue
    \item Trust as Masochism
    \item Trust as Faith
    \item Risk-taking or Gambling
    \item Trust as Confidence
\end{enumerate}

Deutsch's given model above specifically targets formalisation of trust as confidence.

\subsection{Luhmann}
Luhmann, a sociologist who also worked in Trust and related fields, had his own take on formalisms of Trust: that trust was a social tool for reducing the complexity of a social system. Specifically, Lohmann sees trust as being a method whereby agents in a social system can reduce their exposure of \emph{risk} to each other. According to Luhmann, ``Trust{\ldots} pressuposes a situation of risk.''\todo{CITE THIS}\par

Luhmann's work is therefore difficult to form quantitative formalisms from, as his thesis stems from a risk analysis perspective, which can be particularly difficult in a sociotechnical system. However, Luhmann's work remains interesting; a formalism of a human factor like trust would be incomplete without considering the properties of individual human actors as well as these properties' emergent effects in the larger sociotechnical space. For small systems, these social-level properties may not present themselves very strongly; however, most human factors are present regardless of the scale of the system being modelled. Therefore, a formalism of a human factor which fails to consider both psychological and sociological aspects cannot be complete. \par


% Modern trust (logics, Marsh and C&F)
\section{Modern [Computational] Trust methods}
\subsection{Marsh's formalism}
The earliest quantifiable formalism of trust which provides computability, flexibility, and an inspiration from the sociological and psychological work above is that of Stephen Marsh in 1994\cite{Marsh1994FormalisingConcept}. Marsh's work breaks trust up into three core quantifications, where each variable takes some value in the range \({[-1,1)}\):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic Trust \\
    This is the general degree of ``trustingness'' about an agent, or that agent's ordinary inclination to trust.
    \item General Trust \\
    General trust is trust in the context of the agent being trusted. Marsh's original description begins\cite{Marsh1994FormalisingConcept}:
    \begin{displayquote}
        Given two agents, \(x, y \in \mathcal{A}\), to notate '\(x\) trusts \(y\)'  we use: \(T_{x}(y)\). {\ldots}The value represents the amount of trust \(x\) has in \(y\) here.
    \end{displayquote}
    So, General Trust can be seen to be the trust that an agent \(x\) has in \(y\).
    \item Situational Trust \\
    Trust doesn't exist in a vaccum, and the only variable isn't the subject of \(x\)'s trust; \(y\) may have varying degrees of competency in performing an action. Therefore, Situational Trust can be seen to be the trust \(x\) holds that \(y\) can actually perform some task, \safealpha. Marsh helpfully gives the example\cite{Marsh1994FormalisingConcept}:
    \begin{displayquote}
        {\ldots}whilst I may trust my brother to drive me to the airport, I certainly would not trust him to fly the plane!
    \end{displayquote}
\end{enumerate}\todo{Finish notes on Marsh's computational trust model!}

\subsection{Castelfranchi \& Falcone}
As it turns out, cognitive computational trust models that already exist are almost but not quite appropriate for modelling responsibility. The C\&F trust model requires only four main ingredients to formulate a cognitive trust model:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{x}, a truster
    \item \emph{y}, a subject of trust
    \item \emph{g}, a goal of \emph{x}
    \item \emph{\safealpha}, an action of \emph{y}
\end{enumerate}\par

This model gets us close to where we need to be to model responsibility; like responsibility modelling often does, it assumes two agents. There also exists some goal which can be met, which --- to use C\&F terminology --- is \emph{delegated} by \emph{x} to \emph{y}. \emph{Y} can achieve this goal through some action, \emph{\safealpha}. So far, all of this forms the beginning of a foundation for cognitive responsibility; what turns delegation of a task into the consignment of responsibility is that of obligation, and the understanding of obligation. \par

It is evident that trust and responsibility models are, even in the human-like cognitive approach, very similar. However, there are drawbacks which mean that we cannot directly apply C\&F theory to the idea of computational responsibility: it does not represent any degree of obligation or address the specific problem of judging responsibility at all.\par

Nevertheless, this presents an exciting insight into work to be done to produce a formalism of responsibility. Particularly, it is evident that there is at least some technical value in listing the individual components as C\&F do. Their simple, reduced approach implies that with the correct identification of elements of responsibility, our formalism can be similarly simple. It is also enouraging that connections between trust and responsibility modelling seem to readily present themselves. We can therefore expect our formalism to rightly exhibit a similar structure and features.\par

% --Omitted because I'm not yet read up enough on Gambetta.-- 
%\subsection{Gambetta}
%For the purposes of building a computatational formalism specifically, Gambetta's work is interesting mostly as a precursor to Marsh's. However, some concepts of Marsh's model are strikingly similar to Gambetta's.\par

%Gambetta's trade is ordinarily sociology. However, I include his work in this section because it is similar to Marsh's in its representation of values for its traits, which is important for Marsh's model's computational nature. 

\subsection{Ian Sommerville, Sociotechnical Systems, and Responsibility Modelling}\todo{Finish discssing Sommerville's contribution to the state of the art.}
Sommerville's work focuses largely on sociotechnical systems and responsibility modelling --- in this way, Sommerville's work is not typically concerned with computational models of trust, as the above were. However, his work does begin to border on our own advancements, providing responsibility modelling formalisms.\par

% Formalisms generally graphical
It is important to note that Ian Sommerville has been a particularly prolific writer for a researcher in the sociotechnical systems scene. Sommerville's modelling systems are sometimes graphical\cite{sommerville_graphical_responsibility}. Unfortunately, graphical modelling systems do not lend themselves particularly well to computational formalism: they don't yield naturally to numerical analysis; they are generally designed for the purposes of human visual analysis, instead of logical reasoning; they are often difficult to represent non-graphically, which arguably makes input and manipulation too complex for the purposes of designing a complex intelligent agent around.\par

Ultimately, though, graphical responsibility modelling systems are designed for representing the responsibilities of a single agent at a given point in time; a responsibility formalism, by contrast, should be a series of metrics and rules which can apply to arbitrary reasoning of an agent's responsibility through time, with that agent using the formalism to reason about its changing responsibilities. In other words, graphical responsibility modelling differs from a responsibility formalism in that a responsibility formalism needs to \emph{generalise} reasonsing about how responsibility, as a concept, ``behaves''.

% Sociotechnical perspective on responsibility
% Causal and Consequential responsibility --- just a brief outline, more when we discuss Scanlon in Philosophy section \cref{subsec:philosophy}
Nevertheless, some sociotechnical work on responsibility prevents an invaluable addition to relevant literature for developing its computational formalism. In particular is Sommervile's work on ``Causal'' and ``Consequential'' responsibilities. In defining these terms, Sommerville writes\cite{sommerville_dependable_systems_chap_8}:

\begin{displayquote}
    Consequential responsibility can only be assigned to a person, a role or an organisation – automated components cannot be blamed. Causal responsibility reflects who or what is responsible for making something happen or avoiding some undesirable system state. It is often the case that these are separated.
\end{displayquote}

The seperation of concerns between consequential and causal responsibilities can help us to inform the structure and nature of a responsibility formalism. Particularly, one can simplify these definitions to be that:

\begin{displayquote}
    Consequential responsibilities are responsibilities which relate to a state arrived at in the past, and the relationship of actors and actions with said state.
\end{displayquote}\par

\begin{displayquote}
    Causal responsibilities are responsibilities which relate to future states, and the actors and actions which are potentially assigned with the goal of arriving at said state.
\end{displayquote}

This seperation of past repsonsibilities and future responsibilities means that we can structure the concerns and operation of a responsible agent according to a given formalism. Particularly, for our purposes, the assessment of one's responsibility to arrive at future states --- one's assessment of its \emph{Causal Responsibilities} --- might be informed by information an agent's information about its previous responsibilities and its ability to act responsibly --- one's \emph{Consequential Responsibilities}. Therefore, we might decide to create a responsibility formalism which specifically models the change in causal responsibility, by assessing consequential responsibility.\par

As we approach a review of philosophical literature in \cref{subsec:philosophy}, we will find that a formalism geared toward causal responsibility is not only a very attractive way to model from a philosophical perspective, but that the philosophical literature on responsibility has converged on similar definitions of responsibility. Therefore, there appears to be a strong case that causal-first models --- aside from their simple structure and readiness to be tied into an agent's decision functions --- are a sound way of approaching the problem of framing problems concerning responsibility,  because of the consensus across fields which rarely interact.

% There's not much quantifiable on responsibility, but like Marsh, we can start from a non-quantified place and try to quantify it
% Philosophy and moral responsibility
\section{Philosophy of Moral Responsibility}\label{subsec:philosophy}
Philosophy regarding moral responsibility is an area whose literature is both wide and deep. That said, not all moral repsonsibility literature is relevant to a computational repsonsibility project; lots of it is designed from a social analysis perspective which would be difficult to implement in any useful way. Other areas, however, present more promise for studies regarding formalisms.\par

\subsection{Peter F. Strawson}
One example of research with utility in a computational way is that of Peter F Strawson, particularly in his seminal essay, Freedom and Resentment~\cite{strawson}. Strawson's topic actually revolves around whether determinism has any impact on ``free will'' --- a discussion clearly outside the scope of this project --- but in forming his argument creates some key conepts that we can use to consider the applicability of a responsibility formalism to a computational system, as well as touching on what that formalism would look like.\par

Strawson's fundamental argument can be construed as being that determinism doesn't affect what human factors --- like Responsibility and Trust --- mean, because these concepts are founded on the relationships between human actors, rather than being inherant to the human actors themselves. As computer scientists, we can extrapolate this argument out to a sociotechnical environment. That is: Strawson's argument applies to both socila \emph{and} technological agents within a sociotechnical world. Using Strawson's reasoning, then, we can firmly conclude that it \emph{does} make sense to create ``responsible'' computers, because responsibility makes sense as a trait for a computer to have in the same way it might a human actor.\par

Strawson's insights don't stop there, though. He also produces an interestingly rigorous analysis of how ordinarily fuzzy human factors can be formalised appropriately:

\begin{displayquote}
    Indignation, disapprobation, like resentment, tend to inhibit or at least to limit our goodwill towards the object of these attitudes, tend to promote an at least partial and temporary withdrawal of goodwill; they do so in proportion as they are strong; and their strength is in general proportioned to what is felt to be the magnitude of the injury and to the degree to which the agent’s will is identified with, or indifferent to, it.
\end{displayquote}\cite{strawson}\par

Strawson captures an essential component of Marsh's computational trust model: an actor's actions influence the percieved trustworthiness of an agent in proportion of the magnitude of the ``trustworthiness'' of their actions. This concept, Strawson's elucidation shows, is one which can also extend to responsibility; it influences all of the human factors Strawson seeks to address in his essay (i.e.\ all human factors).\par

This gives us an insight into how a realistic computational trust model might function: its perception of responsibility should alter depending on external factors. We are aware, however, that people's actions are not the only things which can affect our feeling of responsibility: all sociotechnical factors might. For example, the ``Bystander Effect''\cite{unresponsive_bystander} occurs when one feels less responsible for acting in an emergency situation because of the number of people present who could help; in the end, nobody does, because every person's sense of responsibility is weakened. However, it is not weakened by any person's actions: it's influenced by a set of sociotechnical factors, of which the feelings that Strawson discusses are a subset.\par

A suitable conclusion one might draw, then, would be that a valid computational model of responsibility \emph{must} take into account an analysis of the sociotechnical environment of the responsible agent. It would also be valid to draw the conclusion --- as a result of the first of Strawson's points discussed --- that it makes sense to talk about ``trusting'' and ``responsible'' computational agents as if they were humans. Another important conclusion to draw from this part of Stawson's discussion is that this is one way in which agents' interaction is meaningful: therefore, there is a significant body of work to be undertaken in the combination of trust and responsibility formalisms to the field of HCI\@. Some of this work is already underway\cite{Marsh2011, Macy2002}. \par

\subsection{Thomas M. Scanlon}
In his essay, Justice, Responsibility, and the Demands of Equality\cite{scanlon2006justice}, Thomas Scanlon assesses responsibility as having two factors which bear striking resemblance to Sommerville's ``Causal'' and ``Consequential'' Responsibilities: ``Attributive'' and ``Substantive'' Responsibilities.\par

Scanlon discusses ``Attributive'' responsibilities as a group of duties according to the definition:
\begin{displayquote}
    What a person sees as a reason for acting, thinking, or feeling a certain way.
\end{displayquote}\par

For the purposes of later discussion, utility, and slight simplification, I will generalise Scanlon's definition to be ``responsibilities for future actions''. He also discusses ``Substantive'' responsibilities, which are loosely defined as responsibilities for the choices an agent has made, taking into account the effects they have and obligations at the time. We can generalise these to be ``responsibilities for past actions''. While in doing so, I reduce Scanlon's definitions to a discussion of action as opposed to the wider gamut of human properties, this framing sufficiently limits the scope of the work to apply elegantly to decision theory. Therefore, we can begin to apply Scanlon's work to the actions taken by responsible computational agents.\par

This limitation of scope also enables us to tie Sommerville's sociotechnical research to work done in the philosophical sphere. A complete responsible computational system, therefore, would be suitable for the same scrutiny that human agents currently undergo in the field of moral philosophy. It also, like Sommerville's work, presents us with a framework for thinking about the scope of responsibilities that an artificially intelligent agent might be subject to.\par

Beyond philosophical waxing lyrical, we have reason to limit our formalism to a subset of responsibilities Sommerville and Scanlon describe. Specifically, we can use Sommerivlle's ``Consequential'' or Scanlon's ``Substantive'' responsibilities to tailor a responsible agent's judgement of its ``Causal'' or ``Attributive'' responsibilities. This structure will act as a scaffolding for the simplified proposed framework in \cref{sec:work_plan}.

\subsection{Aside: Philosophy's impact on Computing Science}
It's worth noting that Philosophy and Computing Science are unusual bedfellows. However, this need not be the case. As we've seen already, and will continue to observe, there is a definite need for computing science to make use of and contribute to research involving human factors --- whether those factors be sociological, psychological, ethnographic, or even philosophical. What's more, philosophical research may well have an impact on the ethics and cultural implications that certain advances in Computing Science might entail. When discussing matters of potentially existential levels of risk, it is important to have the foresight to construct solid, informed arguments about our role in the grander scope of things.\par

To this end, I believe collaboration between Philosophy and Computing Science should be a more routine affair. Some interdisciplinary work of this form is already underway: Nick Bostrom's Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in the USA are two excellent examples of Computing Science and Philosophy coming together to produce vitally important work, which greatly influences the progression of the field of AI Safety.\par


% Comparing early trust and early responsibility: psychology/sociology of trust and philosophy of responsibility
\section{Comparing Trust and Responsibility}
Trust and responsibility are similar concepts. Seen through the lens of C\&F, this is particularly clear: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item They both concern themselves with actions and goals
    \item They're both naturally framed in terms of task delegation
    \item They both follow Strawson's note on how agents with human factors change their outlook with respect to these factors through interaction.
\end{itemize}

Trust and Responsibility's similarity regarding task delegation is particularly interesting: this might allow a responsibility formalism to operate in a similar way to trust, meaning that much of the existing literature on Trust could be reappropriated (with some research) for the purposes of computational responsibility. Indeed, one definition of responsibility for a task might be the obligation to act on a delegated task. A corollary of C\&F argue that task delegaton is inherantly trust; then, all one need do to extend a trust formalism to a responsibility formalism would be to augment C\&F's axioms to include an agent's obligation, and one's formalism would be complete!\par

Unfortunately, C\&F's formalism, while technically calculable by a computer, uses logical expressions to evaluate trust. For the purposes of an application such as a decision function of an intelligent agent, unless that agent follows a structure such as a BDI model, this would not be terribly useful --- though it's worth noting that granular models of C\&F also exist\cite{}\todo{find citation for this}.

% --Also worth mentioning that responsibility's not as useful for risk analysis as trust is.--
